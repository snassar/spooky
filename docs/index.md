## Project Overview

Spooky is a modern SSH automation tool written in Go. It lets you execute commands and scripts on multiple remote servers using HCL2 configuration files. Spooky is designed to be a lightweight, declarative, and parallel alternative to Ansible.

- **Declarative**: Use HCL2 to define servers and actions
- **Parallel**: Run actions on many servers at once
- **Tag-based**: Target servers flexibly using tags
- **Secure**: SSH key authentication preferred
- **Extensible**: Easily add new actions and server groups
