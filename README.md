# Spooky - SSH Automation Tool

[![Test Coverage](coverage.svg)](https://github.com/snassar/spooky)

Spooky is an automation tool written in Go that allows you to execute commands and scripts on multiple remote servers using HCL2 configuration files. It provides a declarative way to manage server operations with support for parallel execution and flexible server targeting. spooky uses SSH to communicate with other computers 

When spooky grows up it wants to be Ansible.

**Notice**: This project is influenced heavily by agentic coding as part of the process of learning go.

## Features

- üöÄ **Declarative Configuration**: Use HCL2 files to define servers and actions
- üîó **SSH Connectivity**: Secure connections with password or key-based authentication
- ‚ö° **Parallel Execution**: Run actions on multiple servers simultaneously
- üè∑Ô∏è **Tag-based Targeting**: Target servers using tags for flexible grouping
- üìù **Script Support**: Execute both inline commands and external script files
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Built-in configuration validation and syntax checking
- üîç **Listing**: View servers and actions defined in configuration files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- target systems must be accessible via SSH

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snassar/spooky.git
cd spooky
go mod tidy
go build -o spooky
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Execute actions from configuration file
./spooky execute config.hcl

# Validate configuration file
./spooky validate config.hcl

# List servers and actions in configuration
./spooky list config.hcl

# Execute with parallel processing
./spooky execute -p config.hcl

# Set custom timeout (in seconds)
./spooky execute -t 60 config.hcl
```

### Configuration File Format

Spooky uses HCL2 configuration files to define servers and actions. Here's an example:

```hcl
# Define servers
server "web-server-1" {
  host     = "192.168.1.10"
  port     = 22
  user     = "admin"
  password = "your-password"
  # key_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"  # Alternative to password
  tags = {
    environment = "production"
    role        = "web"
  }
}

# Define actions
action "check-status" {
  description = "Check system status"
  command     = "uptime && df -h"
  servers     = ["web-server-1"]  # Target specific servers
  # tags = ["production"]         # Or target by tags
  parallel    = true              # Execute in parallel
}
```

### Server Configuration

Each server block defines a remote server:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the server
- `host`: Server IP address or hostname
- `port`: SSH port (default: 22)
- `user`: SSH username
- `password`: SSH password (or use `key_file`)
- `key_file`: Path to SSH private key file
- `tags`: Key-value pairs for server categorization

### Action Configuration

Each action block defines an operation to perform:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the action
- `description`: Human-readable description
- `command`: Inline command to execute
- `script`: Path to script file to execute
- `servers`: List of specific server names to target
- `tags`: List of tags to match servers
- `timeout`: Custom timeout for this action
- `parallel`: Execute on servers in parallel

### Server Targeting

Actions can target servers in three ways:

1. **Specific servers**: `servers = ["server1", "server2"]`
2. **Tag-based**: `tags = ["production", "web"]`
3. **All servers**: Omit both `servers` and `tags`

## Examples

### System Maintenance

```hcl
server "prod-web-1" {
  host     = "10.0.1.10"
  user     = "admin"
  password = "secure-password"
  tags = {
    environment = "production"
    role        = "web"
  }
}

server "prod-web-2" {
  host     = "10.0.1.11"
  user     = "admin"
  password = "secure-password"
  tags = {
    environment = "production"
    role        = "web"
  }
}

action "update-system" {
  description = "Update system packages"
  command     = "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"
  tags        = ["production"]
  parallel    = true
}

action "restart-services" {
  description = "Restart web services"
  command     = "sudo systemctl restart nginx"
  tags        = ["web"]
  parallel    = true
}
```

### Database Operations

```hcl
server "db-master" {
  host     = "10.0.2.10"
  user     = "dbadmin"
  key_file = "~/.ssh/db_key"
  tags = {
    environment = "production"
    role        = "database"
  }
}

action "backup-database" {
  description = "Create database backup"
  script      = "./scripts/backup.sh"
  servers     = ["db-master"]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Store sensitive information (passwords, keys) securely
- Use SSH key authentication when possible
- Limit SSH user permissions on target servers
- Consider using environment variables for credentials
- Regularly rotate passwords and keys

## Error Handling

Spooky provides detailed error reporting:

- Connection failures are reported per server
- Command execution errors include stderr output
- Configuration validation errors prevent execution
- Parallel execution continues even if some servers fail

## Testing

Spooky includes basic unit and integration tests to help ensure reliability.

### Running Tests

You can run tests directly using Go commands:

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
go test ./... -tags=integration

# Run unit tests only (exclude integration tests)
go test ./...

# Run integration tests only
go test -tags=integration ./tests/integration/...

# Run tests with coverage report
go test -cover ./...
```

### Test Coverage Tool

For detailed coverage analysis, install the go-test-coverage tool:

```bash
go install github.com/vladopajic/go-test-coverage/v2@latest
```

Then run:

```bash
go test ./... -coverprofile=./cover.out -covermode=atomic -coverpkg=./...
```

Run the code coverage tool

```bash
go-test-coverage --config=./tests/testcoverage.yml
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Co-located with source files (e.g., `config_test.go`)
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/` using [gliderlabs/ssh](https://github.com/gliderlabs/ssh) for mock SSH servers
- **Test Fixtures**: Sample configurations and scripts in `tests/fixtures/`
- **Test Helpers**: Common utilities in `tests/helpers/`

### Current Test Coverage

The test suite currently covers:
- Basic configuration parsing and validation
- SSH connection and authentication
- Simple command execution
- Basic error handling

**Note**: This is a work in progress. Additional test coverage for advanced features, edge cases, and parallel execution is planned.

## Project Assumptions

### Core Assumptions
- SSH key authentication is preferred over passwords
- We currently only support Ed25519 keys only
- We currently do not support RSA keys
- We currently do not support DSA keys
- Windows compatibility is required
- macOS compatibility is required
- linux compatibility is required
- Integration tests use https://github.com/gliderlabs/ssh
- Unit tests must be co-located with source files
- Integration tests must be located under `./tests/`
- Example configuration files and snippets must be located under `./examples/`

### Design Decisions
- Use HCL2 for configuratio files
- Do not use JSON for configuration files
- Do not use YAML for configuration files
- Parallel execution is optional per action
- Server targeting via tags or explicit names
- No persistent state or database required

### Constraints
- Make is supported
- Must work without Make
- Focus on basic functionality first
